# GiA
A GUI-oriented, graph problem-solving C++ software.

## About
*GiA* is a software built in **C++** programming language with **Qt5** libraries. It allows a user to input a desired graph and run a desired graph algorithm (such as *finding shortest paths*, *constructing a minimum cost spanning tree*, *finding transitive closure*, ...) on it.

## Development
GiA is in a very early development stage. You can see the list of the things that have been successfully developed so far, as well as the next feature that is being worked on right now.
- [x] GUI prototype completed
- [ ] Graphic representation of graph implemented
  - [x] nodes
  - [ ] edges
  - [ ] everything is functioning as one
  - [ ] matrix representation
- [ ] Implement button procedures
- [ ] ...
