It allows a user to input a desired graph and run a desired graph algorithm (such as *finding shortest paths*, *constructing a minimum cost spanning tree*, *finding transitive closure*, ...) on it.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nGiA is in a very early development stage. You can see the list of the things that have been successfully developed so far, as well as the next feature that is being worked on right now.\r\n- [x] Complete GUI prototype.\r\n- [ ] Implement button procedures.\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you want to contact the developer, send an email to [ajzenhamernikola@gmail.com](mailto:ajzenhamernikola@gmail.com) with the subject starting with \"\\[GiA\\]\".\r\n",
